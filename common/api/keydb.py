<Purpose>
   This is the API that should be used to interact with the Key Database.
   Functions in this module are the only way that other code should interact
   with the Key Database.
   
   The init_keydb() method must be called before calling the other methods.
   
   For info on setting up and security access to the keydb, see the file
   clearinghouse/keydb/README.txt.

  <Purpose>
    Initialize the keydb api.

    Does nothing for the moment, actually. Maybe someday it will setup a
    connection pool or do other important initialization on the database.
    We can't just make a single connection and create a new cursor for
    each request because that's not how cursors work, at least with MySQLdb.

      A description of what this key is used for. E.g. "donor:[usernamehere]"
