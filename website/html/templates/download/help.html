    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction to {{ TESTBED }} Donations</a></h2>

    <p>By
      running <a href="{{ TESTBED_URL }}">{{ TESTBED }}</a>
      on your computer, you are contributing to a growing testbed of
      hundreds of machines around the world. Your donation will make
      available some resources on your computer for use by other
      {{ TESTBED }} users. The {{ TESTBED }} project strives to provide a testbed
      for more accurate network experimentation and to enable
      researchers to test their hypotheses on an testbed of Internet
      scale free of charge.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you for donating to the {{ TESTBED }}
    testbed!</strong></p>

    <p>On the download page, you may notice that it specifies that
      this installation of {{ TESTBED }} will be crediting the donated
      resources to {{ TESTBED }} user <strong>{{ username }}</strong>. By
      downloading the installer from this page, you are donating
      resources to this particular user.</p>

    <p>The {{ TESTBED }} project provides a highly portable framework for
      remote execution. {{ TESTBED }} is <strong>secure</strong> and provides
      good <strong>performance-isolation</strong>.  Programs that run on the
      donated resources are isolated so that a program cannot write or
      read files it is not supposed to or perform other insecure
      operations on your computer. The {{ TESTBED }} framework ensures fair
      play for each donation by isolating the performance of all
      program that run on the donated resources. Our promise to you is
      to use no more than 10% of your computer's
      resources. <strong>*</strong></p>

    <h2><a name="install">Installing {{ TESTBED }}</a></h2> 
    <p>Running {{ TESTBED }} on your machine is easy. Simply start the
      install script (<code>install.bat</code>
      or <code>install.sh</code>, depending on the type of your
      system), and the application will do three things.  (1) start
      the node manager program (2) start up the software updater, and
      (3) register the node manager to start automatically on system
      startup.</p>

    <h2><a name="pause">Pausing {{ TESTBED }}</a></h2>
    <p>To pause the execution of {{ TESTBED }}, run 
    <code>stop_seattle</code>.  To unpause {{ TESTBED }}, run 
    <code>start_seattle</code>.  During the paused period,
    your computer's resources will not be consumed by student
    programs.</p> 

    <h2><a name="uninstall">Uninstalling {{ TESTBED }}</a></h2>
    <p>If you decide to end your donation, {{ TESTBED }} can be uninstalled
      simply by running the python script <code>seattleuninstaller.py</code>
      (or the script <code>uninstall.sh</code>).  This process will
      stop the node manager, and remove all traces of {{ TESTBED }} from
      your system.</p>
